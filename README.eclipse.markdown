To use Eclipse as a development environment for Moxie Proxy, do this:

* Execute an ANT build:`ant`
* Start Eclipse
* Within Eclipse, do
    * File - Import...
    * Existing Projects into Workspace - Next
    * Select root directory - Browse
    * {Select the moxie folder} ... for me, this is "/home/uli/git/moxie"
